# Detection-of-COVID-based-Respiratory-Virus-using-SD-GAN-and-Vision-Transformer

AIM:
To develop an Application for Detection of COVID based Respiratory Virus in the CXR Images using Vision Transformer (ViT) Model.

OBJECTIVE:
- To accurately and timely identify COVID-19 positive patients using chest radiography.
- The existing CNN-based deep learning methods lack global context, therefore Vision Transformer (ViT) model is used for COVID-19 screening.
